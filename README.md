# Visual Studio Code Tools for AI Haha
Visual Studio Code Tools for AI is an extension to build, test, and deploy Deep Learning / AI solutions. It seamlessly integrates with Azure Machine Learning for robust experimentation capabilities, including but not limited to submitting data preparation and model training jobs transparently to different compute targets. Additionally, it provides support for custom metrics and run history tracking, enabling data science reproducibility and auditing. Enterprise ready collaboration, allow to securely work on project with other people.

Get started with deep learning using [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit), [Google TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), or other deep-learning frameworks today.

## Features

### Develop deep learning and AI solutions across Windows and MacOS
VS Code Tools for AI is a cross-platform extension that supports deep learning frameworks including [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit), [Google TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and more.  

Because it's an IDE we've enabled familiar code editor features like syntax highlighting, IntelliSense (auto-completion) and text auto formatting. You can interactively test your deep learning application in your local environment using step-through debugging on local variables and models.

### Find and share examples via the gallery  
Visual Studio Code Tools for AI is integrated with Azure Machine Learning to make it easy to browse through a gallery of sample experiments using CNTK, TensorFlow, MMLSpark and more. This makes it easy to learn and share with others.

### Scale out deep learning model training and/or inferencing to the cloud
This extension makes it easy to train models on your local computer or you can submit jobs to the cloud by using our integration with Azure Machine Learning. You can submit jobs to different compute targets like Spark clusters, Azure GPU virtual machines and more. Besides, [Azure Batch](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/batch/) and [Open Platform for AI (PAI)](https://github.com/Microsoft/pai) are also supported.

### View recent job performance and details
Once the jobs are submitted, you can list the jobs, check the job details and download models, logs, etc. from the run history.

### Manage storage on compute targets
The extension provides a storage explorer which enables you to manage your files on remote machines, Azure Batch clusters, PAI clusters, etc. You can create/delete folders, upload/download files within the VS Code easily.

## Commands
The extension provides several commands in the Command Palette for working with deep learning and machine learning:
- **AI: Azure - Login**:  Login to Azure to access resources used by Azure ML / Azure BatchAI.
- **AI: Azure - Set Subscription**:  Set your Azure Subscription to use for Azure ML / Azure BatchAI
- **AI: Open Azure ML Sample Explorer**: Quickly get started with machine learning and deep learning experimentation by downloading sample projects you can run and modify to meet your needs 
- **AI: Azure ML - Open Terminal**: Open Azure CLI terminal to access full Azure feature set
- **AI: Add Platform Configuration**: Configure compute target (remote VM, BatchAI cluster, PAI cluster) used for training job. **For BatchAI, this command creates a cluster in Azure**.
- **AI: Edit Platform Configuration**: Modify compute target settings.
- **AI: Remove Platform Configuration**: Remove a compute target configuration. **For BatchAI, this command removes the cluster in Azure**.
- **AI: Submit Job**: Submit a training job to remote Linux VMs, BatchAI clusters, PAI clusters, etc.
- **AI: Edit Job Properties**: Modify job settings.
- **AI: List Jobs**: View list of recent jobs you've submitted and their details
- **AI: Open Storage Explorer**: View and manage storage on remote compute targets.
